	<h1>Student Testimonials</h1>
	<section>
		<h1>Student A</h1>
		<blockquote> 
			"I would definitely recommend the college of management BSIT program. I picked the 
			College of Management over the College of Science and Mathematics because it offers an education 
			that covers a lot of skills that can be used in life. Furthermore, it offers a broad range of 
			topics to pursue for your interests. My experience with the College of Management BSIT program 
			so far is marvelous and my favorite part so far is the in-class interactions that happen between 
			the professor and students since it offers a great way to absorb the content and get to know the 
			professor.""
		</blockquote>
		<h1>Student B</h1>
		<blockquote>
			“The BSIT program at CM has a diverse group of students with IT backgrounds who are 
			ready to share their knowledge and experience with one another. Professors use their unique 
			professional experience to help students prepare for certifications and jobs. They may teach 
			a wide range of students, from those who are just getting started in IT to those who are 
			well-versed in the field. This program emphasizes collaboration between teachers and students 
			in order to complete hands-on laboratories that prepare students for real-world IT jobs. 
			Throughout the program, I developed a network of people on whom I can rely for help and 
			direction throughout my IT career. The training has given me the confidence and abilities 
			necessary to excel in the sector of information technology."

			“So far, it's been a great experience. As I work toward my degree, I have found the professors 
			and staff to be quite kind and helpful. My major's curriculum is well-structured, allowing me 
			to gain real-world experience in the field I want to pursue. They have been quite helpful to me 
			in a variety of ways. This school appeals to me since it allows me to obtain the 
			education I seek.”
